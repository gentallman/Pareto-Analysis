Pareto Table and Pareto Analysis
</h2>  



A **Pareto Table** is a tabular representation of data used in **Pareto Analysis**, which follows the **Pareto Principle (80/20 rule)**. This principle states that **80% of effects come from 20% of causes**, meaning a small number of factors often contribute to most of the outcomes.

### **What is Pareto Analysis?**  
**Pareto Analysis** is a decision-making technique used to identify the most significant factors in a dataset. It helps prioritize issues, resources, or improvements based on their impact. It is widely used in **quality control, business process improvement, and customer service analysis**.  

### **Steps in Pareto Analysis**
1. **Identify the Problem Categories** – List all potential factors contributing to a problem (e.g., product defects, service delays, customer complaints).  
2. **Collect Data** – Measure the frequency of each category.  
3. **Sort the Data in Descending Order** – Arrange categories from highest to lowest frequency.  
4. **Calculate Cumulative Frequency & Percentage** – Compute cumulative totals and percentages to identify the most critical factors.  
5. **Plot a Pareto Chart** – Visualize the data with a **bar chart** (showing frequency) and a **line chart** (showing cumulative percentage).  
6. **Identify the "Vital Few" Factors** – Determine which categories contribute to **80% of the total impact** and prioritize improvements in those areas.

## **Pareto Table Example**
A **Pareto Table** is used in Pareto Analysis to organize the data before visualization.

| **Issue Type**     | **Frequency** | **Cumulative Frequency** | **Percentage** | **Cumulative Percentage** |
|--------------------|-------------|-------------------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| Late Deliveries   | 50          | 50                      | 50%         | 50%                     |
| Damaged Products  | 30          | 80                      | 30%         | 80%                     |
| Wrong Item Sent   | 10          | 90                      | 10%         | 90%                     |
| Other Issues      | 10          | 100                     | 10%         | 100%                    |

In this example:
- **80% of complaints** come from **Late Deliveries and Damaged Products**.
- **Pareto Analysis** suggests focusing on these two categories first to achieve maximum impact.

## **Pareto Analysis in Action**
### **Use Cases of Pareto Analysis**
- **Quality Control** – Identify defects causing most rejections.  
- **Customer Support** – Prioritize common customer complaints.  
- **Sales & Marketing** – Focus on top-performing products or customers.  
- **Business Process Improvement** – Optimize areas with the highest inefficiencies.
